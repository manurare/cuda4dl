Remember to install libfreeimage-dev by using:

"sudo apt-get install libfreeimage-dev"

Compile using make.

Execute using: "./conv tensorflow.png"

The output are two png images (first convolution and yours). 
Initially they are the same, after you modify the code they should be different.

Good luck!
